# 📕 The BASIN Field Manual

### BASIN makes nature and the benefits it provides to all beings investable.

The **BASIN Field Manual** is the central reference to all that is BASIN. It is our expression of the intertwined, entangled **relational value** of the natural systems we inhabi&#x74;**.** Herein lies what we hope will be a compass, or at least a map, for the path ahead.

***

## Rules?

_**If**_ BASIN had rules they would be:

### Embrace Complexity

Complex is not the same as complicated. Biodiversity, climate, carbon, water, nature, and beyond — economics, finance, politics, law, art, health, wealth, and **well-being** — are all interconnected.

### Stocks & Flows

Ecological economics and ecosystem accounting are based on the principles of stocks and flows. This aptly mirrors nature's basins that store and circulate life-sustaining water. BASIN's model is crafted on this very essence— protecting and stewarding the stocks and flows of Nature's Intrinsic Value.

### Stacking v. Bundling

Stacking splits a place into parts (food, fiber, water, carbon, biodiversity, etc); bundling values the whole. We favor bundling—one instrument, no overlap, holistic valuation. We issue on value, price on cost and let the market close the gap to fund natural asset ensurance.
