# Ecological Indicators & Metrics

Ecological indicators and metrics are of utmost importance to BASIN's natural capital investment approach.&#x20;

With the main goal of BASIN to make natural capital investable we primarily report and quantify in the language of finance: dollars. However, the main goal of **why** we need to make natural capital investable is to protect and restore ecosystems and their ecological function and integrity. In fact ecological indicators are a unit of value that bolster and are linked to financial value.

### Indicator Methodologies and Frameworks

There are numerous ecological indicator and metric methodologies and frameworks ranging from ecosystem condition, ecosystem integrity, ecosystem characteristics, ecosystem services, biodiversity, biocomplexity, wildlife, habitat, species, and climate etc. We have compiled as many as possible in or [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/basinDAO/page/3HpgDaSba), reviewed them and are assimilating them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\_IrNH\_HgoqE8OfxI7wEH-0O-OLZpkb-2cdkIW5C-iKM/edit?usp=sharing). We invite other groups and individuals to collaborate on rationale, implementation, and best practices.

### BASIN Ecological Indicators & Metrics

Any of these 250+ indicators and metrics can be paired with the financial indicators from the [RealValue of Natural Capital](broken-reference) Framework to scale effective nature investment.
