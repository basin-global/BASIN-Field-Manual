**Dependencies on Ecosystem Services in the Outdoor Apparel and Gear Industry**

Companies within the Outdoor Apparel and Gear Industry, operating in the Consumer Discretionary (GICS) sector, are intricately linked to the natural environment. Utilizing tools such as ENCORE and insights from Swiss Re's Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Index, our analysis reveals the deep dependencies these companies have on ecosystem services. This examination is pivotal for identifying environmental risks and opportunities for promoting sustainability.

**ENCORE Tool Insights**

The ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks, and Exposure) tool provides a detailed view of the direct environmental dependencies:

* **Direct Physical Input**: The reliance on natural fibers & materials, sourced from various habitats and species, alongside essential resources like ground and surface water, is fundamental.
* **Enables Production Process**: Water flow maintenance is critical, facilitated by the atmosphere, habitats, and water bodies. Water quality, directly impacted by different species and water ecosystems, is also crucial.
* **Mitigates Direct Impacts**: Ecosystem services such as bioremediation, dilution, and filtration by habitats and species significantly reduce the industry's environmental footprint. The role of the atmosphere, ocean geomorphology, and water ecosystems in dilution processes is also key.
* **Protection from Disruption**: Ecosystem services offer vital protection against natural disruptions, including habitat-based flood and storm protection and mass stabilization and erosion control through land geomorphology and soils.

**Swiss Re Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Index Contributions**

The Swiss Re Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Index further highlights critical dependencies across the industry's value chain:

* **Manufacturing**: Essential services like pollination, air quality and local climate stabilization, water security, soil fertility, erosion control, and timber provision are vital for sustainable manufacturing.
* **Wholesale/Retail**: The sustainability of products is enhanced by maintaining habitat intactness, in addition to the ecosystem services crucial for manufacturing.
* **Transportation and Storage**: Efficient logistics and storage solutions depend on ecosystem services, such as air quality management, water security, and erosion control.
* **Utilities and Waste Management**: Sustainable waste management practices are underpinned by similar dependencies on air quality, water security, and erosion control.

**Source Notes**

This analysis draws on methodologies from ENCORE and Swiss Re, focusing on the direct potential dependencies and impacts of production processes on ecosystem services and natural capital assets. It underscores the Outdoor Apparel and Gear Industry's reliance on natural ecosystems, highlighting the importance of preserving these resources for future sustainability and resilience.
