# FLOW

BASIN STREAMS **FLOW**

BASIN FLOW is the interconnectedness of BASIN's and STREAMS and the flows of value between them. The protocol facilitates these flows.

FLOW is both a noun and verb. As a noun FLOW is any ERC20, ERC1155, or ERC721. As a verb FLOW is 0xSplits and/or Sablier Streams.

## ERC20

Any ERC20 can flow through the protocol. As land stewards, project developers, and most people/orgs want to get paid in "real" money we are focused on USDC, DAI, WETH, GLO etc. Carbon currencies like NCT, BCT, CHAR, MOSS etc and other ecological assets or regenerative money can also flow: any ERC20 on any EVM chain!

### Nature-based Currency

The Stocks and Flows of Natural Capital are inseparable. They are two sides of the same coin per se. To express this interconnectedness we have built **$ENSURE, a nature-based currency**. &#x20;

ENSURE is built on the premise that money, and the value thereof, should be based on what we as a society collectively value. Historically this was shells, tulip bulbs, coal, gold, oil etc. We believe the value of money should be based on fully functioning and thriving ecosystems full of biodiversity.&#x20;

ENSURE ensures nature in perpetuity as both a store of value and medium of exchange and is based on the stocks and flows of natural capital (units of account in $'s).

#### $ENSURE Deployments

ENSURE is cross chain EVM. Provenance is on BASE and EVM supply is managed permissionlessly via Axelar ITS.
