# FLOW

BASIN STREAMS **FLOW**

BASIN FLOW is the interconnectedness of BASIN's and STREAMS and the flows of value between them. The protocol facilitates these flows.

FLOW is both a noun and verb. As a noun FLOW is any ERC20, ERC1155, or ERC721. As a verb FLOW is 0xSplits and/or Sablier Streams.

## ERC20

Any ERC20 can flow through the protocol. As land stewards, project developers, and most people/orgs want to get paid in "real" money we are focused on USDC, DAI, WETH, GLO etc. Carbon currencies like NCT, BCT, CHAR, MOSS etc and other ecological assets or regenerative money can also flow: any ERC20 on any EVM chain!

### Nature-based Currency: $ENSURE

The Stocks and Flows of Natural Capital are inseparable. They are two sides of the same coin per se. To express this interconnectedness we have built **$ENSURE, a nature-based currency**. &#x20;

ENSURE is built on the premise that money, and the value thereof, should be based on what we as a society collectively value. Historically this was shells, tulip bulbs, coal, gold, oil etc. We believe the value of money should be based on fully functioning and thriving ecosystems full of biodiversity.&#x20;

ENSURE ensures nature in perpetuity as both a store of value and medium of exchange and is based on the stocks and flows of natural capital (units of account in $'s).

#### $ENSURE Deployments

ENSURE is cross chain EVM. Provenance is on BASE and EVM supply is managed permissionlessly via Axelar ITS.

## ERC1155 & ERC721

BASIN Accounts can hold _any_ 1155 or 721 in any quantity.&#x20;

We also have our own [1155's](../streams.md) and [721's](../.basin.md) that are part of the BASIN Protocol.

## Spits and Sablier

A key part of the BASIN Protocol uses Splits and Sablier to FLOW value though the protocol.&#x20;

### Splits

Splits are baked into our Certificates of Ensurance at the contract level. (i.e. see Splits section of any STREAM on Zora) Splits automatically fund pre-defined BASIN Accounts.

#### Examples

[nature.flow](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xa187F8CBdd36D63967c33f5BD4dD4B9ECA51270e/?chainId=8453) is the to level Splits contract for the BASIN Protocol and currently live on Base, Arb, and Zora.

[bioregion.flow](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x7c6c6D96Ce47e8C44a08cE9Ec8cCa79969Bd76c1/?chainId=8453) funds 185 bioregions and currently live on Base and Arb.&#x20;

### Sablier

We are working with the Sablier team to build an "Ensurance Escrow" contract that holds a real asset as collateral until the the Ensurance Policy Premium is paid and once paid the asset it transferred to the Protocol to be held in perpetuity entrust.

Sablier also has an "open stream" contract in the works that will fund nature.flow in perpetuity.
