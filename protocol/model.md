# Model

## Metacrisis

BASIN was founded on the belief that addressing the metacrisis at the climate-biodiversity-social nexus requires novel organizational structures and cooperation mechanisms.&#x20;

## Transdisciplinary Results

The complexity of these interconnected challenges necessitates the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams to produce transdisciplinary outcomes.&#x20;

## Revenue, Business & Operational Model

To this end, the BASIN Protocol revenue, business, and operational model is specifically designed to incentivize such cooperation. This model was detailed in our [v1 documentation](https://github.com/basin-global/docs-archived/tree/main/how) and has evolved into [Natural Asset Ensurance](../ensurance/natural-asset-ensurance.md).
