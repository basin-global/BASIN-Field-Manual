# Incentives

At the core of Regenerative Finance is incentives and how regenerative mechanisms can be built into the activities and outcomes we seek.

As a member operated protocol, incentives in BASIN are being designed around community platform fees, STREAM swaps, Total Value Locked (TVL), and discounts on member provided products and services.

We consider these indicators, as well as others, in our incentive design:

* CO2 PPM
* Biocomplexity Scores
* Living Planet Index
* GINI Index
* Gross Happiness Index
* SDG Tracker
* NASAâ€™s Land Use and Land Cover Change (LCLUC) Program Metrics
* Heat Index & Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)
* STREAMS Floor Price
